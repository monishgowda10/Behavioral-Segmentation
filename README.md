## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze and segment customer behavior in a retail context using historical sales data. The project applies Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, alongside K-Means clustering, to group customers into distinctive segments.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing from Excel files.
- Behavioral segmentation using RFM analysis.
- K-Means clustering to identify customer segments.
- Data visualization for insights and exploratory data analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monishgowda10/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Colab notebook: [Behavioral_Segmentation.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sIwrF4_KpmMQUJa94eMXbMSyuyfg3Vgn?usp=sharing)
2. Ensure `RetailStoreData.xlsx` is available in your working directory.
3. Execute the cells to perform data analysis and clustering.

## Results
- Customers are segmented into groups such as 'VIP Customers', 'Loyal Customers', etc.
- The analysis provides insights into revenue contribution and purchase patterns across different segments.

### Additional Tips:
- Ensure the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary packages and dependencies.
- Replace placeholder links such as `link-to-colab-notebook`, `link-to-segment-distribution-image`, `yourusername`, and `repo-name` with actual URLs and values.
- Consider adding sections for additional analysis, case studies, or FAQs if applicable. 

This README template can be adjusted according to your specific project needs and details, providing a clear understanding to contributors and users alike.
